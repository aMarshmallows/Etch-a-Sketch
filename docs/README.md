# Etch-a-Sketch
Welcome to Etch-a-Sketch! This is a web app based on the mechanical drawing toy "etch-a-sketch". This is the first project I completed from the Odin Project, which was my main resource for learning web development.
Move the slider to change the resolution of the sketch area, and change the color of your pen using the color selector. You can also erase and clear the grid.
Enjoy the live demo here (on Chrome and not on mobile!): https://amarshmallows.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/
